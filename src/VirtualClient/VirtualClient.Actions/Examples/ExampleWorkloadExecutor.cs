            // action/executor, monitor or dependency installer/handler. These core dependencies can be used to interoperate 
            // with the Virtual Client core runtime platform as well as the system on which it is running. The core dependencies
            // include the following. The interfaces and implementations can be found in the VirtualClient.Core project:
            // - IApiClientManager
            //   Virtual Client API client creation and management.
            //
            // - IBlobManager
            //   Used to interface with blob stores (e.g. Azure Blob store).
            //
            // - IDiskManager
            //   Used to access information about disks on the system, to create mount points and to initialize/format disks.
            //
            // - IFileSystem (.NET out-of-box abstraction)
            //   Used to access folders and files on the file system.
            //
            // - IFirewallManager
            //   Used to add rules and ports to the local firewall on the system.
            //
            // - ILogger (.NET out-of-box abstraction)
            //   Used to log ALL telemetry emitted by the Virtual Client.
            //
            // - IPackageManager
            //   Used to access dependency packages on the system and to download/extract packages from remote stores (e.g. storage account blobs).
            //
            // - ProcessManager
            //   Used to create and manage operating system processes used to run executables for workloads, tests etc...
            //
            // - IStateManager
            //   Used to create and manage state objects on the local system.
            //
            // - ISystemInfo
            //   Used to supply information about the system on which Virtual Client is running (e.g. OS platform, CPU architecture etc...).
            //
            // - ISystemManagement
            //   Core interface provides all core dependencies for the Virtual Client platform. This interface contains all of the dependencies
            //   noted above and is used primarily as an extensibility point for each of them.

            // Parameters:
            // ==============================================================================================================
            // The 'parameters' passed into the component are those that are defined in the workload or monitoring profile for
            // that particular component. Parameters allow a given action/executor, monitor or dependency installer/handler
            // component to be flexible for supporting different scenarios. Certain parameters (defined at the top of the
            // profile) can be overridden on the command line by the user/automation.

            // General Flow:
            // ==============================================================================================================
            // All components in the Virtual Client codebase follow a consistent logical workflow. This is because all
            // Virtual Client components derive from the base class 'VirtualClientComponent'. The component methods are executed
            // in the following order:
            //
            // 1) IsSupported
            //    Whether or not the component should be executed on the system.
            //    - Does this component support the current platform/architecture?
            //    - Does this component support the current distro of the operating system.
            //    - Should this component be executed? 
            //
            // 2) Validate
            //    Was the component given the information it needs? Allows the developer to perform validations/checks on the 
            //    parameters provided to ensure they are correct and that expected parameters exist.
            // 
            // 3) InitializeAsync
            //    Does the component have the dependencies it needs to succeed? Allows the developer to perform preliminary/initialization work:
            //    - confirming required packages/dependencies
            //    - setting class member variables and properties that will be used later.
            //
            // 4) ExecuteAsync
            //    Allows the developer to do the main body of work associated with the component. This might be running a workload or test 
            //    and capturing metrics. This might be running a stress test on the system that does not itself produce any specific metrics.
            //
            // 5) CleanupAsync
            //    Allows the developer to perform any cleanup steps/operations required. Its a good idea to always cleanup any artifacts
            //    that were created during the execution of the component in case the same profile is executed again on the system
            //    (i.e. components should be idempotent).
