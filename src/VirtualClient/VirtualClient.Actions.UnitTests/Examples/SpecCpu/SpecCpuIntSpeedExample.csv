"See the configuration file for details."

"Operating System Notes"

"'ulimit -s unlimited' was used to set environment stack size"

"runcpu command invoked through numactl i.e.:"
"numactl --interleave=all runcpu <etc>"
"'echo 8 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio' run as root to limit dirty cache to 8% of"
memory.
"'echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness' run as root to limit swap usage to minimum"
necessary.
"'echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode' run as root to free node-local memory"
"and avoid remote memory usage."
"'sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' run as root to reset filesystem caches."
"'sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0' run as root to disable address space layout"
