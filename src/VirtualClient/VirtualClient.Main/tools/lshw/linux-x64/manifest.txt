Version: B.02.19.59 (amd64)
Documentation: https://github.com/lyonel/lshw
Download Location: None (built from Git repo)

This version of lshw was built from the master branch of the lshw repo itself. We found a bug fix in the version of this command.
The command would return a "Segmentation fault" error on some hardware. This was recognized as a bug in the lshw command and was
fixed in the source code location. We use this custom built version of lshw to avoid the bug on Linux VM-based experiments.
