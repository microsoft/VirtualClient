Compiling Wget2 (on Ubuntu)

For Linux-x64:
-----------------------------------------------------
# Download and extract the .tar.gz file with the version you want from the GNU site
https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/
tar -xzvf wget2-2.0.1.tar.gz

# Install required packages
sudo apt install make
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install libssl-dev

# Compile. In the directory to which the .tar.gz package was extracted. Note that we need to
# configure the installation directory so that all of the binaries are consolidated in a single
# directory when we install. Update the paths appropriately.
./configure --prefix=/home/user/wget2-2.0.1/install --libdir=/home/user/wget2-2.0.1/install --bindir=/home/user/wget2-2.0.1/install
make
sudo make install

# Binary location
The compiled binaries will be installed in the path configured as noted above (e.g. /home/user/wget2-2.0.1/install).
We will need all of the files and folders within this directory. You can zip up the entire directory for copying off
of the system if needed.

zip -r /home/user/wget2-2.0.1/install/wget2-2.0.1.zip /home/user/wget2-2.0.1/install
