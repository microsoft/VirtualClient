# CoreMark
CoreMark is a third party tool that runs a set of benchmark tests in order to measure CPU performance. CoreMark is a preferred CPU benchmarking
toolset because it is compiled to be specialized for the exact physical characteristics of the CPU on the system.

## What is Being Measured?
CoreMark is designed to be a very simple benchmarking tool. It produces a single-number score that allows users to make quick comparisons
between different processors. CoreMark is compiled on the system for which it will run in order to establish a precise test to evaluate the performance
of the CPU.

CoreMark runs the following CPU-intensive algorithms in order to produce the single-number score. 

| Name                  | Description                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| List Processing       | Find and sort algorithm(s)                                |
| Matrix Manipulation   | Common matrix operations                                  |
| State Machine         | Determine if an input stream contains valid numbers       |
| CRC                   | Cyclic redundancy check                                   |

# CoreMark-Pro
CoreMark-PRO is a comprehensive, advanced processor benchmark that works with and enhances the market-proven industry-standard EEMBC CoreMarkÂ® benchmark. While CoreMark stresses the CPU pipeline, CoreMark-Pro tests the entire processor, adding comprehensive support for multicore technology, a combination of integer and floating-point workloads, and data sets for utilizing larger memory subsystems. Together, EEMBC CoreMark and CoreMark-PRO provide a standard benchmark covering the spectrum from low-end microcontrollers to high-performance computing processors.
