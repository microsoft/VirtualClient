# LAPACK Workload Profiles
The following profiles run customer-representative or benchmarking scenarios using the LAPACK workload.  

* [Workload Details](./lapack.md)  

## PERF-CPU-LAPACK.json
Runs a CPU-intensive workload using the LAPACK toolset to test the performance of the CPU in processing different tests for Fortran subroutines.
This profile is designed to identify general/broad regressions when compared against a baseline by testing routines that provide complete 
solutions for the most common problems of numerical linear algebra.

* [Workload Profile](https://github.com/microsoft/VirtualClient/blob/main/src/VirtualClient/VirtualClient.Main/profiles/PERF-CPU-LAPACK.json) 

* **Supported Platform/Architectures**
  * linux-x64
  * linux-arm64
  * win-x64
  * win-arm64

* **Supports Disconnected Scenarios**  
  * No. Internet connection required.

* **Dependencies**  
  The dependencies defined in the 'Dependencies' section of the profile itself are required in order to run the workload operations effectively.
  * Internet connection.

  Additional information on components that exist within the 'Dependencies' section of the profile can be found in the following locations:
  * [Installing Dependencies](https://microsoft.github.io/VirtualClient/docs/category/dependencies/)

* **Profile Runtimes**  
  See the 'Metadata' section of the profile for estimated runtimes. These timings represent the length of time required to run a single round of profile 
  actions. These timings can be used to determine minimum required runtimes for the Virtual Client in order to get results. These are often estimates based on the
  number of system cores. 

* **Usage Examples**  
  The following section provides a few basic examples of how to use the workload profile.

  ``` bash
  VirtualClient.exe --profile=PERF-CPU-LAPACK.json --system=Demo --timeout=1440 --packageStore="{BlobConnectionString|SAS Uri}"
  ```
