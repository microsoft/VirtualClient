# LAPACK
LAPACK 3.10.0 is an open-source set of libraries written in Fortran 90 and provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations,
least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. 
It has been designed to be efficient on a wide range of modern high-performance computers.

This toolset was compiled from the official website and modified so that it is easier to integrate into VirtualClient.

## What is Being Measured?
LAPACK is designed to be a very simple benchmarking tool. It produces the amount of time it takes to test a set of LAPACK driver routines
under different precisions such as single precision, double, complex, complex double. 

* Compute times for linear algorithms (single-precision)
* Compute times for linear algorithms (double-precision)
* Compute times for linear algorithms (complex data type, single precision)
* Compute times for linear algorithms (complex data type, double complex precision)
* Compute times for Eigenvalue problems (single-precision)
* Compute times for Eigenvalue problems (double-precision)
* Compute times for Eigenvalue problems (complex data type, single precision)
* Compute times for Eigenvalue problems (complex data type, double complex precision)

## Workload Metrics
The following metrics are examples of those captured by the Virtual Client when running the LAPACK workload.
