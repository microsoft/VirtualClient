# Sysbench OLTP Workload Profiles
The following profiles run customer-representative or benchmarking scenarios using the Sysbench OLTP workload.

* [Workload Details](./sysbench-oltp.md)  
* [Client/Server Workloads](../../guides/0020-client-server.md)

## Client/Server Topology Support
Sysbench OLTP workload profiles support running the workload on both a single system as well as in a client/server topology. This means that the workload supports
operation on a single system or on 2 distinct systems. The client/server topology is typically used when it is desirable to include a network component in the
overall performance evaluation. In a client/server topology, one system operates in the 'Client' role making calls to the system operating in the 'Server' role. 
The Virtual Client instances running on the client and server systems will synchronize with each other before running the workload. In order to support a client/server topology,
an environment layout file MUST be supplied to each instance of the Virtual Client on the command line to describe the IP address/location of other Virtual Client instances. An
environment layout file is not required for the single system topology.

* [Environment Layouts](../../guides/0020-client-server.md)

In the environment layout file provided to the Virtual Client, define the role of the client system/VM as "Client" and the role of the server system(s)/VM(s) as "Server".
The spelling of the roles must be exact. The IP addresses of the systems/VMs must be correct as well. The following example illustrates the
idea. The name of the client must match the name of the system or the value of the agent ID passed in on the command line.

``` bash
# Single System (environment layout not required)
./VirtualClient --profile=PERF-MYSQL-SYSBENCH-OLTP.json --system=Juno --timeout=1440

# Multi-System
# On Client Role System...
./VirtualClient --profile=PERF-MYSQL-SYSBENCH-OLTP.json --system=Juno --timeout=1440 --clientId=Client01 --layoutPath=/any/path/to/layout.json

# On Server Role System...
./VirtualClient --profile=PERF-MYSQL-SYSBENCH-OLTP.json--system=Juno --timeout=1440 --clientId=Server01 --layoutPath=/any/path/to/layout.json

# Example contents of the 'layout.json' file:
{
    "clients": [
        {
            "name": "Client01",
            "role": "Client",
            "ipAddress": "10.1.0.1"
        },
        {
            "name": "Server01",
            "role": "Server",
            "ipAddress": "10.1.0.2"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Balanced/In Memory Scenario Support
In addition to the standard configuration, Virtual Client offers two tuned scenarios to run the SysbenchOLTP workload under: Balanced and In-Memory.

* **Balanced**: The database size is about twice as big as the memory/RAM on the system. Half of the database will fit in memory, and half will fit on disk.
  Target CPU usage is about 40-60% with somewhat heavy disk I/O usage. The configuration supports 1-4 additional data disks, and the database will be
  distributed among the disks as proportionately as possible.
* **In-Memory**: The database size is just about the size of the memory/RAM on the system. Target CPU usage is about 80-90%, with a significant amount of disk
  I/O usage.

A database scenario can be selected by denoting it in the profile. Note that the DatabaseScenario option is required in both the SysbenchOLTPServerExecutor and the SysbenchOLTPClientExecutor for the Balanced Scenario -- there is preparation needed on both the client and the server to configure the balanced scenario. For the In Memory scenario, it simply needs to be denoted on the SysbenchOLTPServerExecutor.

It is highly recommended to use the default thread and record count values when utilizing one of these scenarios. For the Balanced Scenario, the default is 1 thread and 10^vCPU number of records. For the In Memory Scenario, the presets are listed below, under 'Profile Parameters'.

``` bash
{
  "Type": "SysbenchOLTPServerExecutor",
  "Parameters": 
  {
      "Scenario": "mysql_server",
      "DatabaseScenario": "Balanced",
      "Role": "Server"
  }
},
{
  "Type": "SysbenchOLTPClientExecutor",
  "Parameters": 
  {
    "Scenario": "oltp_read_write_T8_TB16_REC500",
    "DatabaseName": "sbtest",
    "DatabaseScenario": "Balanced",
    "Role": "Client",
    "Threads": "8",
    "NumTables": "16",
    "RecordCount": "500",
    "DurationSecs": "00:20:00",

  }
},
```

## PERF-MYSQL-SYSBENCH-OLTP.json
Runs a system-intensive workload using the Sysbench Benchmark to test the bandwidth of CPU, Memory, and Disk I/O.

* **Profile Runtimes**  
  See the 'Metadata' section of the profile for estimated runtimes. These timings represent the length of time required to run a single round of profile 
  actions. These timings can be used to determine minimum required runtimes for the Virtual Client in order to get results. These are often estimates based on the
  number of system cores. 

* **Usage Examples**
  The following section provides a few basic examples of how to use the workload profile.

  ``` bash
  # When running on a single system (environment layout not required)
  ./VirtualClient --profile=PERF-MYSQL-SYSBENCH-OLTP.json --system=Demo --timeout=1440" --packageStore="{BlobConnectionString|SAS Uri}

  # Override the default database name
  ./VirtualClient --profile=PERF-MYSQL-SYSBENCH-OLTP.json --system=Demo --timeout=1440" --parameters="DatabaseName=mytestDB" --packageStore="{BlobConnectionString|SAS Uri}

  # When running in a client/server environment
  ./VirtualClient --profile=PERF-MYSQL-SYSBENCH-OLTP.json --system=Demo --timeout=1440 --clientId=Client01 --layout="/any/path/to/layout.json" --packageStore="{BlobConnectionString|SAS Uri}
  ./VirtualClient --profile=PERF-MYSQL-SYSBENCH-OLTP.json --system=Demo --timeout=1440 --clientId=Server01  --layout="/any/path/to/layout.json" --packageStore="{BlobConnectionString|SAS Uri}
  ```
