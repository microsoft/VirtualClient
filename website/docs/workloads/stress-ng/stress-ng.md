# StressNg
stress-ng will stress test a computer system in various selectable ways. 
It was designed to exercise various physical subsystems of a computer as well as the various operating system kernel interfaces. 

stress-ng was originally intended to make a machine work hard and trip hardware issues such as thermal overruns as well as operating system bugs 
that only occur when a system is being thrashed hard. Use stress-ng with caution as some of the tests can make a system run hot on poorly designed 
hardware and also can cause excessive system thrashing which may be difficult to stop.
