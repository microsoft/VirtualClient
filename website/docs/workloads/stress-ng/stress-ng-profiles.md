# Stress-ng Workload Profiles
The following profiles run customer-representative or benchmarking scenarios using the StressNg workload.

* [Workload Details](./stress-ng.md)  

:::danger
* Use Stress-ng with caution as some of the tests can make a system run hot on poorly designed hardware and also can cause excessive system thrashing which may be difficult to stop.*
:::

## PERF-STRESSNG.json
Runs the Stress-ng workload in short but constant bursts to assess the performance of a system under stress.

* [Workload Profile](https://github.com/microsoft/VirtualClient/blob/main/src/VirtualClient/VirtualClient.Main/profiles/PERF-STRESSNG.json) 

* **Supported Platform/Architectures**
  * linux-x64
  * linux-arm64

* **Supports Disconnected Scenarios**  
  * No. Internet connection required.

* **Dependencies**  
  The dependencies defined in the 'Dependencies' section of the profile itself are required in order to run the workload operations effectively.
  * Internet connection.

  Additional information on components that exist within the 'Dependencies' section of the profile can be found in the following locations:
  * [Installing Dependencies](https://microsoft.github.io/VirtualClient/docs/category/dependencies/)

* **Profile Parameters**
  The following parameters can be optionally supplied on the command line to modify the behaviors of the workload.

  | Parameter | Purpose | Default Value | Note |
  |-----------|---------|---------------|------|
  | CommandLine | The CommandLine Arguments to be provided to StressNg | "--timeout 60" | "The commandline parameter --yaml is programatically added, do not add it in profile. By default, --metrics flag is ON, --cpu is set to ProcessorCount and the default timeout is 60 seconds." |

* **Profile Runtimes**  
  See the 'Metadata' section of the profile for estimated runtimes. These timings represent the length of time required to run a single round of profile 
  actions. These timings can be used to determine minimum required runtimes for the Virtual Client in order to get results. These are often estimates based on the
  number of system cores. 

* **Usage Examples**  
  The following section provides a few basic examples of how to use the workload profile.

  ``` bash
  # Execute the workload profile
  VirtualClient.exe --profile=PERF-STRESSNG.json --system=Demo --timeout=1440 --packageStore="{BlobConnectionString|SAS Uri}"
  ```
