# SPECviewperf Benchmark
SPECviewperf software measures the 3D graphics performance of systems running under the OpenGL and Direct X application programming interfaces. The benchmark’s workloads, called viewsets, represent graphics content and behavior extracted from professional applications, without the need to install the applications themselves. 

Applications represented by viewsets in SPECviewperf 2020 include Autodesk 3ds Max and Maya for media and entertainment; Dassault Systèmes Catia and Solidworks, PTC Creo, and Siemens NX for CAD/CAM; and two datasets representing professional energy and medical applications.

This benchmark needs a GPU-enabled machine to run.
