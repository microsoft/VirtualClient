# Platform Overview
The Virtual Client is a unified workload and system monitoring platform for running customer-representative scenarios on virtual machines or physical hosts/blades in the Azure Cloud.
The platform supports a wide range of different industry standard/benchmark workloads used to measuring various aspects of the system under test (e.g. CPU, I/O, network performance, power consumption).
The platform additionally provides the ability to capture important performance and reliability measurements from the underlying system. The platform supports all business-critical
Azure environments including guest/VM systems, host/blade systems and data center/DC lab systems. The platform additionally supports both x64 and ARM64 compute architectures.

* **win-x64**
  The workload is supported on the Windows operating system for Intel and AMD x64 architectures.<br/><br/>
* **win-arm64**
  The workload is supported on the Windows operating system for ARM64/AARCH64 architectures.


## Supported Workloads/Benchmarks
The following list of workloads are used by Virtual Client profiles to exercise the system components in a consistent way required to measure performance baselines and differences.

:::caution Comply to licenses you are using
VirtualClient handles the installation and execution of various tools. Individual license files are not prompted for each workload. By using 
VirtualClient, users accept the license of each of the benchmarks individually, comply to the terms for the tool you are using, and take responsibility 
for using them.

## Supported System Monitoring Facilities
The platform supports capturing information from the system in the background while workloads are running. The following list of monitoring facilities are available in the Virtual Client.

:::info
Certain monitoring facilities are only available on specific hardware because they expect specific tools/hardware on the system (e.g. ipmiutil, nvidia monitors).
