# Usage: Using Custom Extensions
The Virtual Client platform supports a few different "extensions" models enabling developers to create feature sets and for users to integrate those into the platform
runtime. This document covers how to use and integrate extensions into the platform. Additional documentation exists that focuses on the development process itself.

* [Developing Extensions](../developing/0020-develop-extensions.md)
* [VC Packages](../developing/0040-vc-packages.md)

## What are Extensions
Extensions in a simple sense are extra feature sets for actions, monitors or dependency handlers that can be developed independently of the core Virtual Client platform
but that can be used by the platform. They enable teams and individuals to create these feature sets in their own repos on their own schedules/time. Developers and users of 
the Virtual Client platform have a few different options to consider when integrating extensions. The sections that follow describes how these extensions
models work and how to use them.

## .NET-Based/Managed Code Extensions
The .NET-based extensions model allows developers and users to provide binaries/.dlls written in a .NET language such as C# and custom profiles to a build of the 
Virtual Client runtime/executable. The Virtual Client then loads these binaries/.dlls at runtime as if they were a part of the Virtual Client runtime package itself.
This model is handy for teams who want to work in their own repo to create new actions, monitors, dependency handlers and custom profiles that reference these
new components. Reference the documentation noted above on `Developing Extensions` for a deeper discussion on the development process involved.

### Versioning 
The VC Team follows a process of semantic versioning with the Virtual Client .NET-based runtime application and framework libraries. The versions of the assemblies/.dlls/.exes 
can be used to determine which version of the Virtual Client runtime/executable (e.g. from NuGet packages) should be used. Use the following instructions to determine
the Virtual Client runtime platform version to use.

* **The version of the Virtual Client runtime/.exe must be >= to the framework version referenced by the extensions**  
  When developing Virtual Client extensions, a version of the `VirtualClient.Framework` package is referenced. This framework package will have a version (e.g. 1.15.0). 
  The binaries/.dlls built and that contain the extensions features have thus taken a "contract" against this specific version of Virtual Client. In order to integrate
  the extensions binaries/.dlls into the Virtual Client, the version of the Virtual Client runtime/.exe must be greater than or equal to the version of the `VirtualClient.Framework` 
  package used to compile the extensions projects.

  For example, suppose the extensions projects were compiled against VirtualClient.Framework version 1.15.0. These extensions can be ran by any version of Virtual Client runtime >=
  to 1.15.0 (e.g. 1.15.0, 1.15.1, 1.15.10 etc...). However, these extensions COULD NOT be used with Virtual Client runtime version 1.14.0.

* **Use a version of Virtual Client runtime/.exe having the major and minor version matching the framework version referenced by the extensions**  
  To ensure compatibility it is generally recommended that the version of the Virtual Client runtime/.exe used to integrate extensions have the same
  major and minor version as the `VirtualClient.Framework` package version referenced by the projects in the extensions repo. So although a user MIGHT
  be able to use a VirtualClient.exe from version 1.17.0 with extensions .dlls compiled targeting VirtualClient.Framework 1.16.0, it would not be advisable
  because the \{major\}.\{minor\} version DOES NOT match (e.g. 1.17 vs. 1.16 respectively). The following table illustrates a few examples as a reference.

  <mark>In general, backwards compatibility for Virtual Client releases is maintained within a \{major\}.\{minor\} range only (e.g. 1.14.0, 1.14.1, 1.14.2, ~~1.15.0~~). The Virtual Client team attempts to honor this most of the time; however, no guarantees are made.</mark>

  https://semver.org/

  ``` bash
  # Semantic Version Format:
  {major_version}.{minor_version}.{patch}
  ```

  Note that the versions of the runtime are for illustratory purposes only and do not necessarily represent actual version  
  of the runtime.

  | VirtualClient.Framework Version (for Extensions) | Virtual Client Runtime Version (for Executable/.exe) Recommendations |
  |--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | 1.14.0                                           | 1.14.0, 1.14.1, 1.14.2...but less than ~~1.15.0~~ |
  | 1.14.5-beta (version = 1.14.5)                   | 1.14.5-beta (version = 1.14.5), 1.14.6-beta (version = 1.14.6), 1.14.7-beta (version = 1.14.7)...but less than ~~1.15.0~~ |
  | 1.15.5                                           | 1.15.5, 1.15.6-beta (version = 1.15.6), 1.15.7-beta (version = 1.15.7), 1.15.8...but less than ~~1.16.0~~     |

### How to Use .NET-Based/Managed Code Extensions
When developing .NET-based extensions, the user/developer will create a simple folder structure with the extensions binaries/.dlls and profiles in it. The folder structure
is covered more in-depth in the `Developing Extensions` and `VC Packages` documentation noted at the top. The following section describes how to incorporate .NET-based extensions.

* **Place Extensions Folder in Default 'packages' Location**  
  The default way to incorporate extensions into the Virtual Client runtime is to add the extensions package into the Virtual Client default 'packages' folder.
  Extensions themselves have a special folder structure that is consistent with other packages (e.g. workload and monitor toolsets) that are incorporated into Virtual Client.
  Simply copy the folder (and its contents) into the 'packages' folder. In fact the extensions packages can even be placed in the 'packages' folder as a .zip/archive file 
  (e.g. any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0.zip) and Virtual Client will extract them on startup.

  ``` bash
  # e.g.
  # Virtual Client is installed (or exists) on the system.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/VirtualClient

  # Extensions packages/folders are placed in the 'packages' folder within.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0.vcpkg

  # Each extensions package may contain 1 or more platform/architecture folders.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-arm64
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/win-arm64
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/win-x64

  # Binary extensions within each supported platform/architecture folder.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/Any.VirtualClient.Extensions.Actions.dll
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/Any.VirtualClient.Extensions.Dependencies.dll
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/Any.VirtualClient.Extensions.Monitors.dll

   # Profile extensions within each supported platform/architecture folder
   # in a 'profiles' sub-folder.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles/MONITORS-CUSTOM-1.json
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles/PERF-CUSTOM-WORKLOAD-1.json
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles/PERF-CUSTOM-WORKLOAD-2.json

  # Virtual Client will search for extensions in the default 'packages' folder location.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64$ VirtualClient --profile=PERF-CUSTOM-WORKLOAD-1.json ...
  ```

* **Define an Alternate Location for the Extensions Folder Location**  
  Virtual Client supports allowing a user to define an alternate/secondary location to discover extensions. To define an alternate location for discovering extensions packages, 
  define the path to the directory where the packages exist using a `VC_PACKAGES_PATH` environment variable. Multiple alternate locations can be defined (similar to the PATH 
  environment variable) by delimiting the paths with a semi-colon (e.g. /home/user/extensions_packages1;/home/user/extensions_packages1). During startup, the runtime will search 
  for packages in both the default 'packages' directory as well as in the alternate location.

  <mark>
  Note that there may not be duplicate binaries or profiles (by name) in the target location. If duplicates (by name) are found, a runtime error will occur.
  </mark>

  ``` bash
  # e.g.
  # Suppose that ackages exist in an alternate location.
  /home/user/extensions_packages

  # Extensions packages/folders are placed in this 'extensions_packages' location.
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0.vcpkg

  # Each extensions package may contain 1 or more platform/architecture folders.
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-arm64
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/win-arm64
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/win-x64

  # Binary extensions within each supported platform/architecture folder.
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/Any.VirtualClient.Extensions.Actions.dll
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/Any.VirtualClient.Extensions.Dependencies.dll
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/Any.VirtualClient.Extensions.Monitors.dll

   # Profile extensions within each supported platform/architecture folder
   # in a 'profiles' sub-folder.
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles/MONITORS-CUSTOM-1.json
  /home/user/extensions_packages/any.virtualclient.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles/PERF-CUSTOM-WORKLOAD-1.json

  # Virtual Client can be instructed to search for extensions in this alternate
  # location in addition to the default 'packages' folder location.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64$ export VC_PACKAGES_PATH=/home/user/extensions_packages
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64$ VirtualClient --profile=PERF-CUSTOM-WORKLOAD-1.json ...
  ```

* **Define an Alternate Location for the Extensions Binaries/.dlls Location**  
  Virtual Client supports allowing a user to define an alternate/secondary location to discover extensions binaries/.dlls specifically. To define an alternate location for 
  discovering extensions binaries/.dlls, define the path to the directory where the binaries exist using a `VC_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. During startup,
  the runtime will search for packages in both the default 'packages' directory as well as in the alternate location. Multiple alternate locations can be defined 
  (similar to the PATH environment variable) by delimiting the paths with a semi-colon (e.g. /home/user/extensions_binaries1;/home/user/extensions_binaries1).  
  This is particularly helpful in testing/debugging scenarios where developers are compiling extensions binaries on the same system enabling a fast inner-development 
  loop.
  
  <mark>
  Note that there may not be duplicate binaries (by name) in the target location. If duplicates (by name) are found, a runtime error will occur.
  </mark>

  ``` bash
  # e.g.
  # Suppose that the binaries exist in an alternate location (e.g. a build output location).
  /home/user/repos/any.team.extensions/out/bin/Debug/x64/Any.Team.VirtualClient.Extensions/net8.0/linux-x64/publish

  # Virtual Client can be instructed to search for extensions binaries in this alternate
  # location in addition to the default 'packages' folder location.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64$ export VC_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/repos/any.team.extensions/out/bin/Debug/x64/Any.Team.VirtualClient.Extensions/net8.0/linux-x64/publish
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64$ VirtualClient --profile=/home/user/repos/any.team.extensions/src/Any.Team.VirtualClient.Extensions/profiles/PERF-CUSTOM-WORKLOAD-1.json ...
  ```

### Script-Based Extensions
The script-based extensions model allows developers and users to provide interpreted scripts written in languages such as Python or PowerShell to to a build of the
Virtual Client runtime/executable. Virtual Client has out-of-box support for running custom scripts and for defining the full workflow specifics within a custom profile.
This extensions model does not typically require any work in the Virtual Client codebase. Users/developers place their extensions in a Virtual Client package the same as
other packages and include any content or binaries (if required) to support the script executions. The folder structure for extensions is covered more in-depth in the 
`Developing Extensions` documentation noted at the top.

Regarding the subject of binaries required to support scripts, the Virtual Client team offers versions of certain script-based/interpreted languages such as PowerShell 7/Core
and Python. These packages can be referenced in a Virtual Client profile and downloaded to support the execution of scripts that depend upon them. The following section describes 
how to incorporate script-based extensions.

* **Place Script Extensions Folder in Default 'packages' Location**  
  The default way to incorporate script-based extensions into the Virtual Client runtime is to add the extensions package into the Virtual Client default 'packages' folder.
  Extensions themselves have a special folder structure that is consistent with other packages (e.g. workloads, monitors) that are incorporated into Virtual Client.
  This makes it easy to incorporate the extensions because they can just be copied into the 'packages' folder. In fact the script extensions packages can even be placed
  in the 'packages' folder as a .zip/archive file (e.g. any.script.extensions.1.0.0.zip) and Virtual Client will extract them on startup.

  ``` bash
  # e.g.
  # Virtual Client is installed (or exists) on the system.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/VirtualClient

  # Script extensions packages/folders are placed in the 'packages' folder within.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/any.script.extensions.1.0.0.vcpkg

  # Each script extensions package may contain 1 or more scripts (and supporting binaries).
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/execute.py
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/some_executable

  # There may be different scripts (and supporting binaries) per platform/architecture. This facility is typically 
  # employed to support applications compiled to run on different OS platforms such as Windows and Linux as well 
  # as on different CPU architectures such as x64 and ARM64. However, there are times when this separation is needed 
  # to support cross-platform/cross-architecture for scripts also.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/execute.py
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/some_executable

  C:\virtualclient.1.15.0\win-x64\packages\any.script.extensions.1.0.0/win-x64/execute.py
  C:\virtualclient.1.15.0\win-x64\packages\any.script.extensions.1.0.0/win-x64/some_executable.exe

   # Profile extensions within each supported platform/architecture folder
   # in a 'profiles' sub-folder.
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles/SCRIPT-WORKLOAD-1.json
  ~/virtualclient.1.15.0/linux-x64/packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles/SCRIPT-WORKLOAD-2.json
  ```

  Script-based extensions can be incorporated into profiles directly. These profiles can be defined in the script-based extensions
  package similarly to .NET-based extensions packages (as illustrated above).

  ``` json
  
  {
    "Description": "Profile to execute script-based extensions.",
    "Metadata": {

          }
        },

            "Type": "PythonExecutor",
            "Parameters": {

                "PackageName": "powershell7",
                "Extract": true
            }
        },
		{
            "Type": "DependencyPackageInstallation",
            "Parameters": {
                "Scenario": "DownloadPythonPackage",

                "Extract": true
            }
        },

            "Type": "DependencyPackageInstallation",
            "Parameters": {
                "Scenario": "DownloadScriptExtensionsPackage1",
                "BlobContainer": "packages",
                "BlobName": "any.script.extensions1.1.0.0.zip",
                "PackageName": "any.script.extensions1",
                "Extract": true
            }
        },
		{
            "Type": "DependencyPackageInstallation",
            "Parameters": {
                "Scenario": "DownloadScriptExtensionsPackage2",
                "BlobContainer": "packages",
                "BlobName": "any.script.extensions2.1.0.0",
                "PackageName": "any.script.extensions2",
                "Extract": true
            }
        }
    ]
  }

  ```

* **Define an Alternate Location for the Script Extensions Folder Location**  
  Another way to integrate script-based extension is to define an alternate/secondary location to discover extensions. To define an alternate location for discovering 
  extensions packages, define the path to the directory where the packages exist using a `VC_PACKAGES_PATH` environment variable. Multiple alternate locations can be defined 
  (similar to the PATH environment variable) by delimiting the paths with a semi-colon (e.g. /home/user/extensions_packages1;/home/user/extensions_packages1). 
  During startup, the runtime will search for packages in both the default 'packages' directory as well as in the alternate location.

  ``` bash
  # e.g.
  # Suppose that the script extensions packages exist in an alternate location.
  /home/user/script_extensions_packages

  # Script extensions packages/folders are placed in this 'script_extensions_packages' location.
  /home/user/script_extensions_packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0
  /home/user/script_extensions_packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/any.script.extensions.1.0.0.vcpkg

  # Each script extensions package may contain 1 or more scripts (and supporting binaries).
  /home/user/script_extensions_packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/execute.py
  /home/user/script_extensions_packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/some_executable

  # There may be different scripts (and supporting binaries) per platform/architecture. This facility is typically 
  # employed to support applications compiled to run on different OS platforms such as Windows and Linux as well 
  # as on different CPU architectures such as x64 and ARM64. However, there are times when this separation is needed 
  # to support cross-platform/cross-architecture for scripts also.
  /home/user/script_extensions_packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/execute.py
  /home/user/script_extensions_packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/some_executable

   # Profile extensions within each supported platform/architecture folder
   # in a 'profiles' sub-folder.
  /home/user/script_extensions_packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles
  /home/user/script_extensions_packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles/SCRIPT-WORKLOAD-1.json
  /home/user/script_extensions_packages/any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/profiles/SCRIPT-WORKLOAD-2.json
  ```
  
## Downloaded Extensions from a Package Store
The default for most Virtual Client scenarios is to download extensions from a package store. The `VirtualClient bootstrap` command can be used to download
extensions from a package store and install them.

``` bash
# Package/Blob Store Structure
/container=packages/blob=crc.vc.extensions.zip

# Execute bootstrap command to download and install the extensions
C:\Users\Any\VirtualClient> VirtualClient.exe bootstrap --package=crc.vc.extensions.zip --name=crcvcextensions --packages="{BlobStoreConnectionString|SAS URI}"
 
# Execute an extensions profile
C:\Users\Any\VirtualClient> VirtualClient.exe --profile=EXAMPLE-WORKLOAD-PROFILE.json --timeout=1440 --packages="{BlobStoreConnectionString|SAS URI}"
```

The developer can choose to use a custom profile for bootstrapping/installing extensions as well.

``` json
# Profile = BOOTSTRAP-EXTENSIONS.json
{
  "Description": "Installs extensions from a package store.",
  "Dependencies": [
      {
          "Type": "DependencyPackageInstallation",
          "Parameters": {
              "Scenario": "InstallCRCExtensionsPackage",
              "BlobContainer": "packages",
              "BlobName": "crc.vc.extensions.zip",
              "PackageName": "crcvcextensions",
              "Extract": true
          }
      }
  ]
}
```

## Script-Based Extensions Walkthrough
The following sections provide a bit more guidance on how to develop script-based extensions for Virtual Client and then to integrate them. Virtual Client provides 
a few different out-of-box components (e.g. Action components) that can be used to make it easier to integrate script-based automation.

### Preliminary Recommendations
To integrate script-based automation into Virtual Client, there are a few simple "rules of engagement". The following section covers those expectations
and requirements.

  * **Package Directory Structure Recommendations**  
    Script-based automation suites are integrated into Virtual Client as packages (see the section on Script-Based Extensions above). The patterns recommended
    above make it easier for script-based automation suites to be integrated following conventions that allow for cross-platform, cross-architecture support.

  * **Script Design Recommendations**  
    Virtual Client provides structured telemetry capture facilities out of the box for any component is defined in a profile and that runs as part of a
    profile workflow. Although it is not required for a script executed as part of a Virtual Client runtime workflow to emit telemetry, it is recommended
    to design scripts such that they meet the following recommendations:

    * **Scripts Should Return a Proper Exit Code**  
      Exit codes define whether a script succeeded or failed. For example, it is common scripts to return a zero (0) exit code when successful and non-zero exit
      codes indicate failures. Furthermore it is recommended that the exit codes for non-successful operations be assigned meaning (i.e. each exit code defines a 
      specific failure reason).

    * **Scripts Should Emit Useful Context/Information to Standard Output**  
      Virtual Client captures the details for scripts that it executes. This includes the standard output stream from the script. It is important to emit useful information
      on the internal operations of a script to the process standard output stream. See [Standard Streams on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams)

    * **Scripts Should Emit Error Information to Standard Error**  
      Similarly, the Virtual Client captures standard error information from the execution of scripts. To ensure it easy to determine the reasons why a script may have failed,
      it is important to emit error context/information to the process standard error stream.

    * **Log Files Should Be Written to a Consistent Location**  
      Virtual Client has facilities for capturing information from log files as well as the ability to upload the log files to a centralized storage location. To ensure ease-of-integration
      for cases when this is desirable, it is recommended that log files be written to a consistent folder location on the file system. Furthermore it is recommended that this folder/directory
      be within the parent directory of the scripts themselves (e.g. a subdirectory -> /any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/logs). 

  * **Metrics Creation Recommendations**  
    One of the most useful features of the Virtual Client platform is that it parses meaningful "metrics" from the execution of workloads, monitors and functional tests. Metrics represent
    objective measurements typically related to performance and reliability that can be used to analyze systems in side-by-side comparisons. The following resources provide context and examples
    for the concept of metrics.

    * [DiskSpd Workload Metrics](https://microsoft.github.io/VirtualClient/docs/workloads/diskspd/)
    * [Geekbench Workload Metrics](https://microsoft.github.io/VirtualClient/docs/workloads/geekbench/)
    
    Virtual Client provides a facility for script-based automation to emit metrics for capture as well. To enable metrics capture, scripts emit the metrics to a single/central file on the file
    system. The file should be named ```test-metrics.json``` and should exist in the same directory as the script that generated it. The file contents should be a simple JSON-formatted structure 
    as illustrated below. Virtual Client will read this file and upload the metrics defined within alongside any out-of-box metrics already captured.

      ``` json
      # Example contents of the 'test-metrics.json' file. Simple key/value pairs. This file should
      # be written to the same directory where the script that generated it exists.
      #
      # e.g.
      # Given a script /any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/install.py, the file should be
      # written to /any.script.extensions.1.0.0/linux-x64/test-metrics.json

      {
          "metric1": "0",
          "metric2": "1.45",
          "metric3": "1279854282929.09"
      }
      ```

### Out-of-Box Components for Execution of Script-Based Automation
The following section provides examples of how scripts can be integrated into the Virtual Client using out-of-box features to integrate script-based
extensions.
  
* **ScriptExecutor**  
This component can be used to execute generic scripts using facilities common to Windows and Linux operating systems (e.g. bash, shell, cmd/bat, scripts and executables).

* **Component Parameters**    
    The following parameters are supported by the `ScriptExecutor` that can be modified in a custom profile to run the scripts.

    |   Parameter  | Purpose |
    |--------------|---------|
    |  Scenario    | Name of the scenario |
    |  ToolName    | Name of the Script/Tool being executed |
    |  CommandLine | The command line arguments to be used with the script/executable |
    |  ScriptPath  | Relative Path of the script inside the workload package that needs to be invoked. |
    |  LogPaths    | A list of file/folder paths separated by semicolons ";". Note that Virtual Client will move any log files found to the central "logs" directory in the Virtual Client executable parent directory. | 
    |  PackageName | Name of the workload package built for running the script. If the workload package is being downloaded from blob package store, this needs to match with the package name defined in DependencyPackageInstallation. | String |
    |  FailFast    | Flag indicates that the application should exit immediately on first/any errors regardless of their severity. | Boolean  |
    |  UsePython3  | (Only valid for PythonExecutor) A true value indicates use of "python3" as environment variable to execute python, a false value will use "python" as the environment variable. | Boolean (Default is true) |

    Example:
    "Actions": [
        {
            "Type": "ScriptExecutor",
            "Parameters": {
                "Scenario": "ExecuteScriptBasedOperation",
                "CommandLine": "argument1 argument2",
                "ScriptPath": "script.sh",
                "LogPaths":  "*.log;*.txt;",
                "ToolName":  "Name_Of_Tool",
                "PackageName":  "exampleWorkload",
                "FailFast":  false,
                "Tags": "Test,VC,Script"
            }
        }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
        {
            "Type": "LinuxPackageInstallation",
            "Parameters": {
                "Scenario": "InstallLinuxPackages",
                "Packages": "python3,python3-pip"
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

    The `ScriptExecutor` component can additionally be used to execute PowerShell and Python scripts using packages with standard cross-platform, cross-architecture support
    that can be downloaded from the Virtual Client package store. This is an important concept for scenarios where signed binaries and scripts are required. Packages in the
    Virtual Client store often contained signed content.
