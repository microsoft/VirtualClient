# Atop
Atop is a toolset that enables support for capturing performance information on Unix/Linux systems. This information is used in the Virtual Client to
to formulate a performance counter base. The Atop toolset is integrated into the Virtual Client platform as a background monitor called the PerfCounterMonitor and is part of the default monitors for the
Virtual Client. Performance counters are sampled every 1 second during the monitor frequency interval noted in the parameters below. At the 
end of this monitor frequency interval, the performance counter samples are aggregated and then emitted. Most of the aggregations are averages;
however, there are a few counters that track the min, max and median of the samples during the frequency interval. The monitor frequency can be
adjusted to change the precision of the counter samples window.

## Atop Output Description
The following section describes the various counters/metrics that are available with the Atop toolset. Note that for consistency with other performance
counter toolsets used by the Virtual Client across Windows and Unix/Linux systems, these performance metrics are mapped to performance counter names 
that are similar in format to those captured on Windows systems. See the link at the top for more details on the exact performance counters that are captured.

| \Processor Information(_Total)\% System Time | The percentage of cpu time spent in kernel mode by all active processes ('sys') |
| \Processor Information(_Total)\% User Time | The percentage of cpu time consumed in user mode ('user') for all active processes (including processes running with a nice value larger than zero) |

| CPU-ipc | When PMC performance monitoring counters are supported by the CPU and the kernel (and atop runs with root privileges), the number of instructions per CPU cycle ('ipc') is shown. The first sample always shows the value 'initial', because the counters are just activated at the moment that atop is started.|
