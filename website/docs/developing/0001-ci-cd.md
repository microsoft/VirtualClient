# Automated Build and CI/CD pipeline
The following sections describe the automated build and release process.


## Pull Request
Every pull request need to pass PR build.

[![Pull Request Build](https://github.com/microsoft/VirtualClient/actions/workflows/pull-request.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/VirtualClient/actions/workflows/pull-request.yml)
- **GitHub Action:** https://github.com/microsoft/VirtualClient/actions/workflows/pull-request.yml


## Documentation Site Build and Publishing

Virtual Client uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to host front page and documents. Every main branch check-in will trigger a document yarn build and publish to gh-pages branch.

- **GitHub Action:** https://github.com/microsoft/VirtualClient/actions/workflows/deploy-doc.yml

If the action is successful and deploys the **gh-pages** branch and the documentation is updated, you will see the following:  
[![Document Deployment](https://github.com/microsoft/VirtualClient/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/VirtualClient/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

If the action is NOT successful, you can find out why the Docusaurus build is failing by attempting to build and run it locally. The following documentation
covers the details for how to do this.

## Build Release Publishing
This build pipeline is not publicly available because it involves Microsoft signing processes. Because of this distinction, pull requests will
always require at least one Microsoft employee to sign off.

New releases of the Virtual Client are published to NuGet.org in the following location:
- https://www.nuget.org/packages/VirtualClient
- https://www.nuget.org/packages/VirtualClient.Framework
